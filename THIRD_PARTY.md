- Binary distributor: <https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries>
- Upstream: <https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/>

## qpdf

- Version: `12.4.0`
- Upstream: <https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf>
- Package source: vcpkg baseline
  `f74a2eade17a628413746557d04db25ccf6e76f9`
- License: Apache License 2.0 or Artistic License 2.0
- Initial feature boundary: no optional OpenSSL, GnuTLS, or Zopfli feature

## libjpeg-turbo

- Version: `3.2.0`
- Upstream: <https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo>
- Package source: transitive qpdf dependency from vcpkg baseline
  `f74a2eade17a628413746557d04db25ccf6e76f9`
- License: IJG License and Modified (3-clause) BSD License
- Direct behavior boundary: Composer validates baseline JPEG input through the
  libjpeg decompression API without retaining decoded samples; qpdf `Pl_DCT`
  provides the existing private JPEG encoding path. No second JPEG
  implementation is added.
- Redistribution: binary installs copy the vcpkg-provided
  `share/libjpeg-turbo/copyright` notice to
  `share/quantapdf/licenses/libjpeg-turbo/copyright`, including the required
  IJG acknowledgement

The qpdf package's installed copyright file and PDFium's root `LICENSE` plus
complete `licenses/` directory are the authoritative redistribution notices.
The installed libjpeg-turbo copyright file is the authoritative notice for the
JPEG codec boundary.

## Adobe Core 14 font metrics

- Source: Adobe Font Metrics files for the 14 PDF Core Fonts, distributed by
  Matplotlib in `mpl-data/fonts/pdfcorefonts`
- Use: numeric advance-width tables for Composer Base 14 text layout
- License: the AFM files and accompanying notice permit use, copying,
  modification, and distribution for any purpose without charge, provided the
  copyright notices are retained. QuantaPDF derives numeric metrics only and
  does not redistribute the AFM files.
